Both interfaces and abstract classes are tools for abstraction in object-oriented programming,
but they have important differences in purpose, capabilities, and usage.

What is Abstraction?

Abstraction is one of the core principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). At its essence, abstraction is:

The process of hiding implementation details while showing only the functionality to the user.

Think of it as focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it.

Two Levels of Abstraction

1. Data Abstraction
Hiding the internal state (data) and requiring interaction through well-defined methods

2. Process Abstraction
Hiding the implementation details of methods while exposing their functionality

How Interfaces Provide Abstraction

An interface creates abstraction by:

Defining a Contract: Specifies what methods an implementing class must provide
Hiding Implementation: Users of the interface don't know how methods are implemented
Focusing on Behavior: Emphasizes what an object can do, not how it's structured

How Abstract Classes Provide Abstraction

An abstract class creates abstraction by:

Partial Implementation: Provides some concrete methods, leaves others abstract
Common Functionality: Implements shared behavior while deferring specific details
Hierarchical Structure: Defines what a type of object is, with some details left to subclasses
