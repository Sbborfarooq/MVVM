In Android development, the LiveData class is part of the Android Architecture Components and is designed to hold and manage UI-related data
in a lifecycle-conscious way. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:


Key Features of LiveData:
Lifecycle Awareness: LiveData is lifecycle-aware, meaning it only updates app component observers that are in an active lifecycle state
(e.g., STARTED or RESUMED). This helps prevent memory leaks and crashes due to stopped activities or fragments.

Data Holder: It acts as a data holder that can be observed for changes. When the data changes, LiveData notifies its active observers, allowing
the UI to update automatically.

No Manual Lifecycle Management: Developers do not need to manage the lifecycle of LiveData manually.
It automatically handles the registration and unregistration of observers based on the lifecycle state of the components.

Support for Multiple Observers: Multiple observers can observe the same LiveData instance, making it easy to share data across different parts
of the application.

Immutable Data: LiveData is designed to be immutable, meaning that the data it holds should not be changed directly. Instead, you should
use a MutableLiveData subclass to change the data (((MutableLiveData mein setValue() aur postValue() methods hote hain jo data ko modify karne ke liye
use hote hain.))), which then notifies observers of the change.

Common Use Cases:
ViewModel Integration: LiveData is often used in conjunction with ViewModel to hold UI-related data that survives configuration changes (like screen rotations).
Data Binding: It can be used with Android's Data Binding Library to automatically update the UI when the data changes.
Reactive Programming: It fits well into reactive programming paradigms, allowing for a more declarative approach to UI updates.
